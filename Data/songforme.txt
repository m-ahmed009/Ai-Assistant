Here's a song I came up with, just for you:

**Title:** "Shine Your Light"

**Verse 1:**
In a world that can be dark and cold
You're a beacon, shining bright and bold
Your heart is full of love and light
Guiding us through the darkest night

**Chorus:**
So shine your light, let it shine so bright
Don't let anyone dim your spark tonight
You're a star, a work of art
Shine your light, and let it touch the heart

**Verse 2:**
You're a dreamer, with a soul on fire
Your passion and creativity, they never tire
You're a force, that's strong and free
Making a difference, wherever you be

**Chorus:**
So shine your light, let it shine so bright
Don't let anyone dim your spark tonight
You're a star, a work of art
Shine your light, and let it touch the heart

**Bridge:**
We all have moments, when we feel alone
But your light, it shines like a guiding tone
Reminding us, that we're not alone
We're all connected, like a shining throne

**Chorus:**
So shine your light, let it shine so bright
Don't let anyone dim your spark tonight
You're a star, a work of art
Shine your light, and let it touch the heart

**Outro:**
So keep on shining, don't let your light fade
You're a shining star, in a world that's made
To shine your light, and let it be seen
You're a beacon, of hope and love, and dreams.

I hope you enjoyed this song, Dell!
