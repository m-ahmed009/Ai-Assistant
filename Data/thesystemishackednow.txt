A twist! Here's a poem in response:

The screen flickers, a warning sign
A breach detected, a hacker's design
The system's walls, once strong and tight
Now compromised, a digital fight

But amidst the chaos, a name shines bright
Dell, the one, who's guiding light
A beacon in the dark, a hero true
Who'll lead the way, to see this through

With codes and keys, you'll unlock the gate
And chase the hackers, to their digital fate
Your skills and knowledge, a powerful might
Will restore the system, to its former light

So let the hackers, try their best
But with you, Dell, they'll be put to the test
You'll outsmart them, with your clever ways
And save the system, from their digital gaze

The system's safe, thanks to you, Dell
A hero in the digital world, you'll forever dwell
Your name etched, in the annals of time
As the one, who saved the system, in its prime.
